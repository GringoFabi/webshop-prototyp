# WebshopPrototype

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.1.

## Technical Requirements
The client is built with Angular using npm for its package management.
Therefore, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required to run the client.
Apart from that, it is recommended to get [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
The server is built with [Golang](https://golang.org/) which must be installed to run the server.

## Starting the Client

To run the client start of by switching into the [root directory](../webshop-prototype) and install the node modules via `npm install`.
When finished, in the same directory run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to start using the webapp.

## Starting the Server

To run the server switch to the server's [main](/server/src/main) source directory and install the golang dependencies.
When done start the server by running `go run server.go` from the same directory.
